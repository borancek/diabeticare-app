# Application Walkthrough
In this section, I will provide a visual representation of how the application appears during its runtime.

## Initial Launch Screen

<br>
This screen is the initial point of contact for users upon launching the application, inviting them to input their email and password.
<br>
## Main Menu

<br>
Users will arrive at this screen upon successful authorisation on the login page. It offers a personalised touch by displaying the user's own email. This screen features a dedicated news section, focusing on keeping users aware of the latest developments in the diabetes sector. Additionally, it incorporates a "Challenges of the Day" segment, adding a gamification aspect to the application, and encouraging users to embrace healthier lifestyle choices.

## Dictionary Page

<br>
Upon visiting the 'Dictionary page,' users will encounter a list of diabetes-related terms, allowing them to easily access and comprehend medical terminology. This feature addresses a common issue that I came across during the research phase of the project among diabetic patients. They had often struggled with understanding their healthcare providers' terminology. Users also have the convenience of using a search bar to find specific terms they may enter themselves.

## BMI Calculator Page

<br>
This page allows users the capability to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI), a crucial measurement in assessing an individual's health status.
